The Amazon Clone project is an ambitious web application replicating Amazon's e-commerce platform. 
It will feature user authentication, product browsing, searching, and cart management. Users can securely register, sign in, and reset passwords.
The platform aims to emulate Amazon's shopping experience, allowing users to add items to their cart, make purchases, 
and manage their accounts. It focuses on delivering a seamless, secure, and comprehensive e-commerce experience similar to Amazon.
